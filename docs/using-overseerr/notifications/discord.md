# Discord

The Discord notification agent enables you to post notifications to a channel in a server you manage.

{% hint style="info" %}
Users can optionally opt-in to being mentioned in Discord notifications by configuring their [Discord user ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) in their user settings.
{% endhint %}

## Configuration
