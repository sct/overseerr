# Pushover

{% hint style="info" %}
Users can optionally configure personal notifications in their user settings.

User notifications are separate from system notifications, and the available notification types are dependent on user permissions.
{% endhint %}

## Configuration

### Application/API Token

[Register an application](https://pushover.net/apps/build) and enter the API token in this field. (You can use one of the [official icons in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/sct/overseerr/tree/develop/public) when configuring the application.)

For more details on registering applications or the API token, please see the [Pushover API documentation](https://pushover.net/api#registration).

### User Key

Set this to the user key for your Pushover account. Alternatively, you can set this to a group key to deliver notifications to multiple users.

For more details, please see the [Pushover API documentation](https://pushover.net/api#identifiers).
