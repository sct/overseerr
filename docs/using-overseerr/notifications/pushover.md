## Configuration

{% hint style="info" %}
To configure Pushover notifications, you first need to [register an application](https://pushover.net/apps/build) for Overseerr. (You can use one of the [official icons in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/sct/overseerr/tree/develop/public) when configuring the application.)
{% endhint %}
