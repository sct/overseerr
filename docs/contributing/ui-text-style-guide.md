# UI Text Style Guide

When adding new UI text, please be sure to adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Be concise and clear, and use as few words as possible to make your point.
2. Use the Oxford comma where appropriate.
3. Use the appropriate Unicode characters for ellipses, arrows, and other special characters/symbols.
4. Capitalize proper nouns, such as Plex, Radarr, Sonarr, Telegram, Slack, Pushover, etc. Be sure to also use the official capitalization for any abbreviations; e.g., TMDb and IMDb have a lowercase 'b', whereas TheTVDB has a capital 'B'.
5. Title case headings, button text, and form labels. Note that verbs such as "is" should be capitalized, whereas prepositions like "from" should be lowercase (unless as the first or last word of the string, in which case they are also capitalized).
6. Capitalize the first word in validation error messages, dropdowns, and form "tips." These strings should not end in punctuation.
7. Ensure that toast notification strings are complete sentences ending in punctuation.
8. If an additional description or "tip" is required for a form field, it should be styled using the global CSS class `label-tip`.
9. In full sentences, abbreviations like "info" or "auto" should not be used in place of full words, unless referencing the name/label of a specific setting or option which has an abbreviation in its name.
10. Do your best to check for spelling errors and grammatical mistakes.
11. Do not misspell "Overseerr."
