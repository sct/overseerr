# Asking for Support

## Before asking for support, make sure you try these things first

- Make sure you have **updated** to the latest version.
- ["Have you tried turning it off and on again?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn2FB1P_Mn8)
- **Analyzing** your logs, you just might find the solution yourself!
- **Search** the [Wiki](../), [Installation Guides](../getting-started/installation.md), and [FAQs](faq.md).
- If you have questions, feel free to ask them on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PkCWJSeCk7) \(Please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sct/overseerr/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\). Please include a link to your logs. See [How can I share my logs?](asking-for-support.md#how-can-i-share-my-logs) for more details.

## What should I include when asking for support?

When you contact support saying something like "it doesn't work" leaves little to go on to figure out what is wrong for you. When contacting support try to include information such as the following:

- What did you try to do? When you describe what you did to reach the state you are in we may notice something you did different from the instructions, or something that your unique setup requires in addition. Some examples of what to provide here:
  - What command did you enter?
  - What did you click on?
  - What settings did you change?
  - Provide a step-by-step list of what you tried.
- What do you see? We cannot see your screen so some of the following is necessary for us to know what is going on:
  - Did something happen?
  - Did something not happen?
  - Are there any error messages showing?
  - Screenshots can help us see what you are seeing
  - The Overseerr logs show exactly what happened and are often critical for identifying issues \(see [How can I share my logs?](asking-for-support.md#how-can-i-share-my-logs) below\).

## How can I share my logs?

1. Locate the log file at `<Overseeerr-install-directory>/logs/overseerr.log`
2. Open the log file and **copy its contents** into a [**secret gist** on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/). If you upload your logs elsewhere, we may ask you to share them again via GitHub Gist.
3. **Share the link/URL to your secret gist** in the [`#support` channel in our Discord server](https://discord.gg/PkCWJSeCk7).
